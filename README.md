KC3改二 is a browser-platform that aims to provide the best experience in playing your favorite browser games. Yes, you read that right, **games**! It features a plugin system that allows viewers for any game, not just Kantai Collection!

## Download
There's no installation! Just grab the executable file and run it! ... hm? Where's the Chrome extension webstore you ask? Sorry, unlike our previous versions, Kai Ni is a desktop-only application.
