KC3KaiNi is a browser-platform that aims to provide the best experience in playing your favorite browser games. Yes, you read that right, **games**! It features a plugin system that allows viewers for any game, not like its predecessor which was limited to Kantai Collection!

## Download
There's no installation! Just grab the executable file and run it! ... hm? Where's the Chrome extension webstore link you ask? Sorry, unlike our previous versions, Kai Ni is a standalone desktop application.
